        <h2>Introduction</h2>

        <p>Churchill House, at 216 Northbourne Avenue in Braddon, was designed by <a href="architect.html">Robin Boyd</a> for the Winston Churchill Memorial Trust of Australia in 1969-70, and construction was completed in 1971. It was Boyd’s last major commission, and he died prior to its completion. It is one of a small number of larger designs produced by Boyd and was Canberra’s first brutalist building.</p>

        <p>Several components make up the complex. The main building, with east and south wings; the separate north wing or pavilion; the central pool and a rear carpark. The main building forms an L shape and with the north wing it encloses a courtyard with a large ornamental pool. The main building is three storeys high with a four storey lift tower at the southeast corner. The north wing and the carpark are two storeyed.</p>

        <p>Although it has undergone some alterations over the years, the building still displays key features of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brutalist_architecture">brutalist</a> style with its large areas of blank wall and use off-form concrete, sloping structural fins and precast concrete non-loadbearing wall panels, precast fins for sun protection, and vertical slit windows. Churchill House displays a fairly restrained form in comparison with the major Canberra buildings that followed in this style: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cameron_Offices,_Belconnen">Cameron Offices</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Gallery_of_Australia">National Gallery of Australia</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High_Court_of_Australia">High Court of Australia.</a></p>
